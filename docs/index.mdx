# Getting Started

Welcome to the Dicoding Forum API. This is where you will find the definitive
list of currently available methods of the API.

Before you can access other endpoints, you need an access token as a request
header. To get an access token, please register first if you are a new user and
login to get an access token and refresh token. This refresh token will be used
to get a new access token if the previous token has expired. For more info
please go to the next page.

<Info>
  This page is only documentation for the API. Because the server does not
  exist, we can't provide the server url.
