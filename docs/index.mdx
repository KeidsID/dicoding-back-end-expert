Welcome to the Dicoding Forum API Docs. This is where you will find the
definitive list of currently available methods of the API. Use the base url
above to access the server.

<Info>Root endpoint (GET http://13.229.143.139:5000/) will redirect you back to this docs page</Info>

Before you can access other endpoints, you need an access token as a request
header. To get an access token, please register first if you are a new user and
login to get an access token and refresh token. This refresh token will be used
to get a new access token if the previous token has expired. For more info
please navigate to [auth overview](api/auth/overview).
